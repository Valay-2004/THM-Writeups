# TryHackMe Room: Crypto Order

![Task Screenshot](image.png)

## Challenge Overview

The Crypto Order room from TryHackMe is an entry-level cryptography puzzle where participants intercept an encrypted message that always begins with a known header: ORDER:. The ciphertext is protected using a repeating-key XOR cipher, and the task is to decrypt the message and extract the target name, which serves as the flag.

Difficulty: Easy  
Category: Cryptography  
Key Concepts: Repeating-Key XOR, Known-Plaintext Attack  
Flag: `THM{the_hackfinity_highschool}`

---

## Objective

- **Decrypt** the provided XOR-encrypted hex message.
- **Extract** the flag (Cipherâ€™s next target) from the decrypted text.

## Tools Used

- Python (for scripting/automation)
- XOR cipher analysis
- Hex & bytes manipulation

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

**1. Analyze the Problem**

- The given ciphertext appears as hex; it represents a message encrypted with a repeating-key XOR cipher.
- We know the message should begin with `ORDER:` (a known-plaintext attack scenario).

**2. Convert Hex to Bytes**
```py
ciphertext_hex = (
"1c1c01041963730f31352a3a386e24356b3d32392b6f6b0d323c22243f6373"
"1a0d0c302d3b2b1a292a3a38282c2f222d2a112d282c31202d2d2e24352e60"
)
ciphertext = bytes.fromhex(ciphertext_hex)
```


**3. Discover the Key using the Known Header**

- XOR each byte of "ORDER:" with the first 6 bytes of the ciphertext to recover the key:
